# High-Power-Inverting-Buck-Boost-Converter

# Project Description
This project focuses on designing and simulating a high-power inverting buck-boost converter circuit using the TL494 IC, which regulates and controls output voltage and current in switch-mode power supplies. The design emphasizes the use of easily accessible components, heat regulation, and efficient routing techniques.

A 2-layer PCB layout and schematic were created in Altium Designer, incorporating advanced features like the Design Rule Check and a comprehensive Bill of Materials to ensure manufacturability and reliability. The circuit was prototyped and tested on a breadboard, providing valuable hands-on experience with hardware debugging and implementation challenges.

Key features include PWM-based control for efficient voltage regulation, support for both step-up and step-down voltage operation, and detailed thermal considerations for high-power applications.

# Project Details

The created project was based on the Circuit Digest project titled "High Power Inverting Buck-Boost Converter Circuit Design with TL494 IC". 
The original project link is listed below:
https://circuitdigest.com/electronic-circuits/high-power-inverting-buck-boost-converter-circuit-design-with-tl494

I recreated the original designer's schematic on Altium Designer, and utilized it to create a custom PCB board. The schematic and footprint files are shown below.
